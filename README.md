# E-Commerce Graph Database with Neo4j

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to model an E-Commerce system using Neo4j as a Graph Database. It includes key entities such as:

- **Products** 🛒
- **Categories** 📂

The relationships between these nodes help visualize how products belong to categories, customers make purchases, and sales include products.
